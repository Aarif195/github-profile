# React + TypeScript + Vite


 GitHub Profile Finder
A sleek React + TypeScript application that allows users to search any GitHub username and instantly view their profile details and repositories — all in a responsive, elegant layout.

This project was built as part of a frontend coding challenge to practice API integration, data fetching, and responsive UI design.


 Key Features
 **Search GitHub Users:** Enter any username to fetch real-time data from the GitHub API  
 **User Profile Display:** Shows avatar, name, bio, followers, following, and location  
 **Repositories Section:** Lists top repositories with stars, forks, and updated date  
 **Direct Access:** Clicking a repo opens it directly on GitHub in a new tab  
 **Default View:** Displays a default profile on page load  
 **Responsive Design:** Adjusts layout for both desktop and mobile screens  
 **Error Handling:** Shows feedback if a username isn’t found  



 Tech Stack
 **React + TypeScript** — for component-based architecture and type safety  
 **Tailwind CSS** — for fast and responsive styling  
 **GitHub REST API (v3)** — for fetching user and repo data  



Challenge Goal
This challenge helped reinforce:
API data handling and async/await usage
State management with React hooks
Responsive component layout using Tailwind CSS
TypeScript type definitions and props interface design
